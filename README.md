# REST-Basic
Basic REST API implemented in Flask

Done to familiarize with basic REST paradigms and to deepen knowledge of flask and Python.

Will hold data about courses, the reviews for courses, and maintain the model in a sqllite database! 

The model will be accessible via get/post/put/delete HTTP methods.
